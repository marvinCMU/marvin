********************************
When using it for the first time
********************************
See Installation guide
Make sure the project path can be found by ROS
To verify: $roscd mmfpspkg
Make sure to rebuild: rosmake --pre-clean mmfpspkg
roscd mmfpspkg/node_object: make clean; make all

*********************************
If using the pre-built MMFPS VM:
*********************************
First update source in git: 
      git stash
      git pull
Enable the usb camera in Virtualbox:
       Devices-->USB Devices-->[Click on the appropriate device]
Test the camera with cheese. In a term type:
     cheese
Plug in a microphone and test with sound recorder
----------
How to use
----------
To compile: $rosmake mmfpspkg
To run: $roslaunch mmfpspkg xxx.launch
* there are many launch files, run the ones that you need
* check out path /mmfps/mmfpspkg/launch for details
* if you want to run the whole system, use system.launch
To kill: $^C
To run single executable: $roscore
	in another terminal: $roscd mmfpspkg/bin \\\ $./filename

***at current stage, the system is not yet fully implememted
To run:
	Terminal 1: $roscd mmfpspkg/node_object; sh runAll.sh
	Terminal 2: $roslaunch mmfpspkg current.launch (keep this window visible
		    as it provides feedback during speech recognition).
	Terminal 3: $rosrun image_view image_view image:=/camera/image_raw
	Terminal 4: You might want the matlab progress: tail -f mmfpspkg/data_tmp/vision.log

To use:
* Speak 'Intelligentsia' to wake the system up. You should see in Terminal 2 that the trigger word
was detected.
* Point the camera to an object of interest
* Say one of the commands about the object of interest (e.g "Review Bottle" or "Information Cap")
* The list of commands you can use are: Information, Review, Option
* The list of objects you can use are:  adapter airborne boot bottle cap disk halls 
      	      	      	      	  	powder toy tumbler tupperware umbrella

------
Issues
------
*ROS nodes are pretty compute intensive. Make sure to kill them all when not using.
*When killing the runAll process, MATLAB processes stay active. You need to kill 
 those manually by calling: pkill MATLAB
*Not all cameras work on this machine. Troubleshoot with cheese before running the system.

Major Folders/Files
-------------------
1. mmfpspkg
	the main folder, which contains all the library and 
2. mmfpspkg/launch folder:
	contains all launch files
	one for one specific part
3. mmfpspkg/include
	contains external common headers
4. mmfpspkg/library
	contains all library files
5. mmfpspkg/node_xxx
	contains codes for each components
6. code
	codes for the past version of MMFPS, leave it for record
