function top = adjust_boxes(boxes, models)
%Here we take the detection boxes and adjust them so they are 'GT'
%boxes.

%This step is necessary since the exemplars are framed in a slightly
%different window (one of the coarse aspect ratios based on the 8
%pixel cells) than the actual GT window (which can have any possible
%aspect ratio up to the resolution of the original image)

%% Each detection is an alignment between the "coarse_box" and a
%detection window "d", once we find the rigid transformation
%between "coarse_box" and "d", we can apply the same projection to
%the ground truth window
